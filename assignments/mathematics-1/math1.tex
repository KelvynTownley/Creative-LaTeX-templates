% The following line is a subtitle with my personal set, you can use it or discard it. 
\noindent \textcolor{neonBlue}{\textbf{\large About The Pigeonhole Principle}}\\

% From here you must write on your own. What follows are only test notes.
\noindent The Pigeonhole principle says:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white, colframe=neonBlue, leftrule=3mm, sharp corners]
	If n pigeonholes are occupied by n+1 pigeons, at least one pigeonhole is occupied by more than one pigeon.
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent In fact, from a mathematical perspective, let $p$ be the pigeons and $h$ the pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole contains at least $\frac{p}{h}$ pigeons.\\

\noindent \textcolor{neonBlue}{\textbf{\large Examples with applications}}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $m$ is an odd positive integer, then prove that there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $m$ divides $2^n-1$.\\[5mm]
		Let $m$ be an odd positive integer, we consider the finite sequence of powers of 2:
		\begin{equation*}
			2^1,2^2,...,2^m.  
		\end{equation*}
		Since $m$ is odd, it does not divide to any of the above powers. So the possible remainders of $2^i\div m$ (with $1\leq i \leq m$) are:
		\begin{equation*}
			1,\ 2,\ ...,\ m-1 
		\end{equation*}
		Since there are $m-1$ possible remainders (pigeonholes) and $m$ powers of 2 (pigeons), it follows that there exist at least two positive integers $p$ and $q$ (say $p < q \leq m$) such that $2^p$ and $2^q$ have the same remainders in the division by $m$. Thus, it turns out that $m$ divides $2^q-2^p$. Let us note that
		\begin{equation*}
			2^q-2^p=2^p(2^{q-p}-1) 
		\end{equation*}
		Since $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with $p < q$, then $q-p$ is a positive integer (say $n$) and since $m$ does not divide $2^p$, then $m$ divides $2^{n}-1$.
		
		$\therefore$ There is a positive integer $n$ such that $m$ divides $2^n-1$.\\[3cm]
	\item Show that if any eight positive integers are chosen, two of them will have the same remainder when divided by 7.\\[5mm]	
	The remainders that result from dividing any positive integer by $7$ are: $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$; that is, seven possibilities, which can be considered as the pigeonholes, under the analogy of the pigeonhole principle, as shown:
		\begin{center}
			\fbox{\textcolor{gray}{$0$}} \fbox{\textcolor{gray}{$1$}} \fbox{\textcolor{gray}{$2$}} \fbox{\textcolor{gray}{$3$}} \fbox{\textcolor{gray}{$4$}} \fbox{\textcolor{gray}{$5$}} \fbox{\textcolor{gray}{$6$}}
		\end{center}
		
		Then we take 8 integers (inhabitants) that when arranged in the houses, by principle of the pigeonhole, at least in one pigeonhole, there will be more than one inhabitant, as shown:
